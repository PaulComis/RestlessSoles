Appalachian Dancing is an energetic and percussive form of dance that originated in the Appalachian Mountains of America and performed to Old-Time music.

Restless Soles are an Appalachian dance side formed in 2009 who regularly perform around Derbyshire.

You can find a list of [our up-coming dance outs here](shows.md):

Ordinarily we practice from 8pm to 9:30 pm on Monday nights at [The West End Community Centre (DE22 3BL)](https://wecc.org.uk/) on Mackworth Road.
