# Appalacian Dancing

When immigrants from all parts of Europe arrived in the Americas, they brought their language, customs and music with them to create new cultures.

The square dances of the Southern Appalcian mountain region have unique features that mark them out from suqare dances in other parts of the country.

It is a hybrid form that unites elements of dance traditions from this variety of sources.

It is build on a foundation of Scots-Irish reels, and it includes elements of English, French, African American, Native American dance and popular dances of the 18th and 19th centuries.

In the 1920's, performance teams started to spring up and competitions between teams became annual events.

When musicians began using amplification in the 1940's and 50's, dancers added taps to their shoes to make more of an impact in performances.

It is the nature of the square dance for dancers to face inwards, mocing round a notional centre point.

As folk music in general became more popular in the 1960's, the presentation of Appalacian square dancing began to open up for audience display, giving individual dancers - and dancers and their partners - the chance to show off their skills, and this is the style adopted by Restless Soles.

American Old Time music - a distinctive sound that beceame the foundation of Bluegrass - is played by our string band, usually made up of a 5-string banjo (a development of an African instrument) wuth instruments of European origin: fiddle, guitar, mandolin and bass.
