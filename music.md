Dance or play along to some of the tunes:

- [ Lucky at Christmas / Restless Bells](media/RestlessBellsAndTaps.mp3)

Our festive recording of the Dance called "Lucky"

- [Mississippi Sawyer](media/MississippiSawyer.Mp3)

The dance for which is called 'Liberty'.
The title could refer to large trees on the banks of the Mississippi being felled by floods and endangering life on the river as they are carried away down stream. It may also alude to the frantic sawing motion of the bow as fiddle player plays the tune.
